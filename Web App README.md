# Overview

As a software engineer passionate about education technology, I developed this comprehensive online learning platform to deepen my understanding of full-stack web development using Django. This project represents my exploration into building scalable web applications that can handle complex user interactions, database relationships, and dynamic content generation.

The Online Learning Platform is a Django-based web application that enables instructors to create and manage courses while providing students with an intuitive learning experience. The platform features user authentication, course enrollment, progress tracking, and a comprehensive dashboard system. Students can browse courses by category, enroll in programs that interest them, and track their learning progress through interactive lessons.

To start the test server on your computer, navigate to the project directory in your terminal, activate the virtual environment with source learning_platform_env/bin/activate (or learning_platform_env\Scripts\activate on Windows), then run <strong>python manage.py runserver</strong>. Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to access the main homepage, which showcases featured courses and provides navigation to browse the full course catalog.

My primary purpose in developing this software was to gain hands-on experience with Django's Model-View-Template architecture while building a real-world application that solves genuine problems in online education. Through this project, I aimed to master database design with multiple related models, implement secure user authentication systems, create responsive user interfaces, and develop RESTful API endpoints for dynamic content updates. This platform serves as a testament to my ability to architect and implement complex web app.

Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.

# Web Pages

Home Page (/): The landing page dynamically displays featured courses pulled from the database, along with category information and platform statistics. Users can navigate to course listings, authentication pages, or learn about platform features. The page adapts content based on whether users are authenticated, showing different call-to-action buttons and navigation options.

Course List (/courses/): This page dynamically generates a comprehensive catalog of all available courses, with real-time search functionality and category filtering. Each course card displays information pulled from the database including title, description, instructor details, difficulty level, and pricing. The page responds to GET parameters to filter results based on user selections and search queries.

Course Detail (/course/<id>/): Individual course pages are dynamically generated based on the course ID in the URL. The page displays comprehensive course information, lesson listings in an interactive accordion format, instructor details, and enrollment status. For enrolled students, it provides access to individual lessons, while non-enrolled users see enrollment prompts.

Student Dashboard (/dashboard/): A personalized page that dynamically creates content based on the logged-in user's enrollment data. It displays enrolled courses, progress percentages calculated from completed lessons, learning statistics, and quick access to continue learning. The dashboard pulls real-time data from multiple database models to create a comprehensive learning overview.

Lesson Detail (/course/<course_id>/lesson/<lesson_id>/): These pages are dynamically generated for individual lessons within courses. They display lesson content, video players (when applicable), progress tracking, and navigation between lessons. The page checks enrollment status and updates progress in real-time as students mark lessons complete.

Authentication Pages (/accounts/login/, /accounts/register/): Login and registration pages that handle user authentication with Django's built-in forms. After successful authentication, users are redirected to their dashboard, and the navigation dynamically updates to show user-specific options.

The web app transitions between pages through Django's URL routing system, with navigation bars that dynamically update based on user authentication status. Form submissions trigger Django views that process data and redirect users to appropriate pages, while maintaining session state throughout the user journey.

# Development Environment

I developed this software using Visual Studio Code as my primary code editor, leveraging its excellent Python and Django extensions for syntax highlighting, debugging, and integrated terminal functionality. The development environment was set up on a local machine running the Django development server for rapid testing and iteration.

The programming language used is Python 3.8+, specifically leveraging the Django 4.2.7 web framework as the core foundation. Key libraries include:

Django 4.2.7: The main web framework providing MVC architecture, ORM, authentication, and admin interface
Pillow: For handling image uploads and processing for course thumbnails and user profile pictures
python-decouple: For managing environment variables and configuration settings securely
Bootstrap 5.1.3: Frontend CSS framework for responsive design and component styling
Font Awesome 6.0: Icon library for enhanced user interface elements
SQLite: Database engine for development (easily scalable to PostgreSQL for production)

The development workflow utilized Django's built-in development server, database migrations system, and admin interface for rapid prototyping and testing. Git version control was employed throughout the development process for code management and deployment preparation.
